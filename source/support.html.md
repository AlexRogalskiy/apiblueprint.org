## Contributing

We welcome any contributions to the language or parsers, please get in touch
with us on Slack if you're looking for any guidance.

### API Blueprint Request for Comments

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow directly
to the [API Blueprint Language](http://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint).

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the API Blueprint team.

The ["RFC" (request for comments)](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint-rfcs)
process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new
features to enter the language.
